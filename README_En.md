|------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mar 9      | Initial Topic Selection    | Brainstormed potential topics and prioritized directions for research  | Shortlisted: AI-driven task schedulers, AI-based intelligent memory management, voice-activated WASM OS, Rust-based lightweight WebAssembly VM for embedded devices, model-native OS, and AI-powered programming tools. |
| Mar 10     | Topic Refinement           | Narrowed focus after instructor consultation                           | Finalized two directions: 1. AI-enhanced memory management; 2. WASM-based voice-controlled OS for embedded devices (e.g., smart speakers) |
| Mar 11-22  | Preliminary Research       | Divided research tasks across team members                            | Divided tasks: <br>- Ruihan Guo, Yixuan Liu, Jingjing Yang: Explored Topic 1 (AI memory management). <br>- Anqi Wang, Jiarui Fu: Investigated Topic 2 (WASM OS and VM for IoT).     |
| Mar 23     | Final Topic Decision       | Consolidated findings and confirmed project scope with instructor      | Finalized: Build a WASM-compatible voice control module using C for Raspberry Pi, targeting smart home/IoT scenarios. Optional: Integrate AI for OS-level enhancements |
| Mar 24-30  | Research Report            | Structured project goals and divided report tasks                      | Detailed project objectives and divided report sections: <br>1. Project background, significance (Jingjing Yang & Anqi Wang) <br>2. Technical rationale, related work (Yixuan Liu & Ruihan Guo) <br>3. Formatting & integration (Jiarui Fu). |
| Mar 31     | Feasibility Analysis       | Assigned technical validation tasks                                   | Divided tasks :<br>1. Theoretical basis (Yixuan Liu) <br>2. Workflow & environment setup (Jiarui Fu) <br>3. Raspberry Pi-browser communication & speech recognition (Anqi Wang) <br>4. WASM deployment (Jingjing Yang) <br>4. Innovation highlights & architecture design (Ruihan Guo) |
| Apr 6      | Raspberry Pi Exploration   | Reviewed feasibility report and initiated hardware testing            | Confirmed WASM deployment on browser-side; Procured SD card for Raspberry Pi setup |
| Apr 7      | Midterm Prep               | Developed browser-based speech recognition prototype                  | Implemented basic voice-to-command conversion; Explored LLM integration for complex instructions |
| Apr 12     | Midterm Discussion         | Online meeting to align presentation content                          | Planned Raspberry Pi configuration tasks for following week           |
| Apr 14     | Raspberry Pi Setup         | Hands-on hardware configuration                                       | 1. Successfully booted Raspberry Pi with direct peripherals; <br>2. Attempted SSH setup failed due to network connectivity issues |
| Apr 19     | Midterm Presentation       | Divided presentation tasks                                            | Divided presentation tasks: <br>1. Project overview (Jiarui Fu) <br>2.
