| April 25 | Online Discussion | Discussing the later progress arrangement online | The meeting decided that the next step is to focus on building the Raspberry Pi server, and then carry out the connection between the Raspberry Pi side and the browser side. |
| May 1 | Offline research on the connection of Raspberry Pi | According to the methods investigated in the early stage, study the network connection and other connections of the Raspberry Pi to prepare for the later division of labor. | By connecting the Raspberry Pi and the personal computer to the same hotspot, the connection between the personal computer and the Raspberry Pi has been achieved, which is convenient for the later division of labor in the project. | 
|May 11 - May 12|Offline centralized discussion on the project follow-up|Improve the Raspberry Pi connection, install Emscripten for the subsequent conversion from C to Wasm, and discuss whether a large model is needed for semantic analysis of speech text.|The connection of the Raspberry Pi locally has been completed. The display interface of the Raspberry Pi can be viewed on the computer via VNC, and a remote connection to the Raspberry Pi can be made using VSCode SSH-Remote. The installation of Emscripten has been completed. It has been decided in discussions not to use large models for semantic analysis of voice text for the time being, as an optional aspect of the project. The meeting decided that the next step is to set up a simple Flask server on the Raspberry Pi to receive data, and to install WasmEdge to expose GPIO to the WASM module.|
|May 18|Offline collective discussion|Group discussion on progress and encountered issues|At present, the voltage of the Raspberry Pi is unstable and often disconnects. We have decided to find suitable connection cables and a power adapter in the next step to ensure stable voltage. The Raspberry Pi server programming has been completed and will be tested once the Raspberry Pi can connect stably.|
|May 23|Offline collective discussion on the current progress|Group discussion on the current progress|The C language code has been completed to implement the parsing of instructions, and the conversion from C to wasm has been achieved using Emscripten. The next plan is to connect the completed modules for testing.|
|May 30|Offline Group Discussion|Connect LED lights to the Raspberry Pi and attempt to connect all modules in series to test whether the LED lights can be voice-controlled.|When connecting the LED lights to the Raspberry Pi, it was found that the voltage of the Raspberry Pi was unstable, failing to achieve voice control. |
|June 3|Group Discussion on Current Issues|Offline group discussion|Currently, the connection between the speech recognition web page and the Raspberry Pi end, as well as the connection between WebAssembly (wasm) and the web page, can be completed. However, the overall integration has not been achieved yet. Summarize current tasks: Complete the overall integration, add a wake word (optional), implement Docker (optional), and deploy a large language model for speech recognition (optional).|
|June 6|Offline group discussion|Confirm the current progress and plan the later project arrangements|The voice recognition webpage has been optimized by adding a wake - up word "Xiao Ou Xiao Ou". Besides, instead of only receiving feedback by viewing the text on the web, the voice recognition system can start the microphone and speaker to have a conversation with us. The preliminary arrangements from after the exam to before the defense have been made.|
|June 12| Offline group discussion | Summarize the current progress, confirm the defense time and report deadline, and make the next project arrangements.|The project functions have been preliminarily realized, the script for controlling Raspberry Pi pins has been added, and the LED light test has been passed. It is planned to complete the time comparison test between the WASM module parsing instruction scheme and the non-WASM module scheme after the exam, and finish the PPT and defense preparation.|
|June 17| Offline Group Discussion | Summarize current issues and make arrangements for the next steps of the project.| Discuss the issue of web page access restrictions and propose possible solutions; assign tasks, including testing different solutions and researching overall project performance testing schemes.|
|June 20| Offline Group Discussion | Discuss the feasibility of the plan and make arrangements for the next steps of the project.| Summarize and discuss the solutions for web page access restrictions, and select the best solution to advance: that is, using one computer as a server, and other devices control through its IP and corresponding port; refine the plan and complete relevant tasks.|
|June 23| Offline Group Discussion | Summarize current progress and preliminarily prepare for the final presentation.| Preliminarily determine the content and format of the presentation, assess the PPT production and overall effect of the mid-term report, and propose suggestions for improvement.|
|June 24| Offline Group Discussion | Confirm current progress and select content for improvement, focus on preparing for the final presentation.| Conduct relevant tests on the instruction parsing performance of WASM and JavaScript, and summarize them into charts as part of the presentation content; assign research work in different directions of LAB4; preliminarily choose to deploy a large model for speech recognition as the main optimization goal. |
